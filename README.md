# Analysis Report: Financial Dataset - Part 1
# 1.Overall Sales & Profit Performance by Segment:
Gross Sales Domination: The Government segment significantly leads in Sum of Gross Sales, followed by Enterprise and Small Business.
Profit Drivers: While Government and Enterprise are strong in gross sales, the Government segment also holds the largest share (62.51%) of the total profit, highlighting its profitability efficiency.
Sales Distribution: Total sales are unevenly distributed, with Government (44.22%) and Enterprise (35.74%) accounting for the majority, while Midmarket and Channel Partners have smaller contributions.
# 2.Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and Discounts by Segment:
COGS Breakdown: The Government segment has the highest Sum of COGS, aligning with its high gross sales, followed by Small Business and Enterprise.
Discount Allocation: Discounts are also highest in the Government segment, indicating potential strategic pricing or higher volume incentives in this area.
Geographical and Channel Performance:
North America Focus: The sales data by Country and Segment visualization suggests that North America, specifically Atlantis, is a key region, with sales distributed across various channels including Channel Partners, Enterprise, Government, and Midmarket.
# Summary of Key Findings:
The Government segment is the primary driver of both gross sales and profit, despite also incurring the highest COGS and discounts. The Enterprise and Small Business segments are the next most significant contributors to the financial performance. Geographically, North America appears to be a crucial market. Further investigation into the factors driving the Government segment's profitability and the potential for growth in other segments (Midmarket and Channel Partners) would be beneficial.
# Analysis Report: Financial Dataset - Part 2
# 1. Product Performance Overview:
Gross Sales by Discount Band: The "High" discount band generates the most significant gross sales (4,26,89313.00), followed by "Medium" (4,17,82,977.00) and "Low" (3,55,15,454.50). The "None" discount band has the lowest gross sales (79,43,654.00). This suggests that higher discounts correlate with higher gross sales volumes, potentially indicating a strategy of using discounts to drive sales.
Top Performing Products (Gross Sales): Amarilla leads in "Sum of Gross Sales" by product (1,90,37,279.50), followed by Montana (1,65,49,834.50) and Carretera (1,49,37,520.50). VTT and Paseo also contribute significantly.
Units Sold by Product: Velo has the highest "Sum of Units Sold," followed closely by VTT and Amarilla. Carretera, Montana, and Paseo follow. This indicates strong unit sales for Velo, even if its gross sales might be lower than some other products.
Discounts by Product: Velo also accounts for the highest "Sum of Discounts" (2.6M), suggesting that its high unit sales might be driven by substantial discounts. Amarilla and Paseo are next in terms of discounts given.
# 2. Sales Trends Over Time:
Gross Sales by Month: The treemap "Sum of Gross Sales by Month Name" shows seasonal variations in sales. October, September, and June appear to be strong sales months, while January, February, and March show relatively lower gross sales. December and November also represent significant sales periods.
# 3. Manufacturing Price Analysis:
Manufacturing Price by Product: VTT and Amarilla have the highest "Sum of Manufacturing Price," indicating they are either more expensive to produce or are produced in larger quantities. Velo, Montana, and Paseo have considerably lower manufacturing costs.
# Summary of Key Findings:
The report highlights Velo as a high-volume product, driven by substantial discounts, while Amarilla and Montana are key revenue generators with high gross sales. The "High" discount band is crucial for overall gross sales performance. Sales exhibit clear seasonality, peaking in the autumn and summer months. Understanding the relationship between discounts, unit sales, gross sales, and manufacturing costs per product is vital for optimizing profitability and sales strategies. For instance, while Velo has high unit sales and discounts, its manufacturing price is relatively low, which could still make it profitable. Conversely, high-grossing products like Amarilla and Montana, despite higher manufacturing costs, are significant revenue drivers.
